## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

In this challenge, I optimized this online portfolio for speed. In particular, I optimized the critical rendering path and make the dist/index.html to render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques from the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884) course :

* [See the Critical Rendering Path optimizations](https://github.com/rachkoud/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/wiki/Critical-Rendering-Path)

I also optimized the content : 

* [See Content optimizations](https://github.com/rachkoud/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/wiki/Content-Efficiency)

This is the performances measured :
